## Data

Access all langid data inside https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a4Gzu5-vsMAjMUnObG5lm5Ym591Z88JL?usp=sharing

Inside the data folder you will find data for the languages we are focusing on. Each is a monolingual file of a particular language:

* EN - data.en
* ES - data.es
* PT-PT - data.pt-pt
* PT-BR - data.pt-br

Each dataset has also an aditional .ids file which has the origin of the data. These datasets should suffice for the tasks 1 and 2, but
you are welcome to use additional data if you want to. The provided data is in plain UTF-8 text format.

**Tip: The data files provided are very large (for EN,ES and PT), so you might want to subsample a smaller set to train your system**
