Hi, 

This is a short challenge to understand how you work, your thought process and metodology. 
You do not need to be familiar with the described problem to be able to do this challenge. 
In fact, first and foremost, we are going to focus on your reasoning and the steps you took.

Good luck!


## Description

At Unbabel, we deal with many types of multilingual content at all time. Thus, the first thing we 
need to be able to do is to identify these languages properly.

We need you to build a service that provided with a text, identifies the language in which it is 
written, and provides that answer.
We provide you with the initial repo to implement this, and some requirements that the service 
should satisfy. 

Whether you choose to implement an existing approach or compile one, make sure you document it
and explain your reasoning.

### Tasks

1 - Implement a Language Identification service that returns the language code of the language in which the text is written

2 - Implement a functionality to detect code switching (language mixture) and return both languages present in the text

3 - Report performance on the provided test sets


#### Guidelines
* ***Fork this _git repo_*** and add relevant files and explanations for what you feel necessary (starting with a clear description of what is implemented in the READme)
* Make sure you ***document everything*** and assume nothing.
* ***Send us a link to your fork*** as soon as you start working on it, and then let us know when you're done.
* If you can't finish the challenge due to unforeseen personal reasons let us know ASAP so we can adapt your deadline and/or challenge.
* Any challenge related questions, technical or otherwise, feel free to contact us:
